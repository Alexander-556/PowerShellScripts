## Introduction

Recap from previous section on CLI elements.

The confusion: "PowerShell is both a shell and a scripting language?"

Why this matters to learners.

## What Is a Shell?

Simple definition: an interface to the operating system.

Interactive use: run commands, manage files, inspect processes.

Examples: PowerShell, Bash, cmd.exe.

Key takeaway: Shells let you talk to the system.

## What Is a Scripting Language?

Definition: a programming language designed for automation.

Can handle variables, loops, conditionals, functions.

Usually interpreted, not compiled.

Examples: PowerShell, Python, Bash, JavaScript.

Key takeaway: Scripting languages let you automate logic.

## How Are They Different?

Clear table comparing:

Shell vs scripting language

Use case: one-off vs reusable

Interactive vs file-based

Analogy: "Shell is like talking live; scripting is like writing instructions."

## What Makes PowerShell Special?

PowerShell as both:

Shell for interactive management

Scripting language with rich logic and reusable code

Bonus: Object-based, not just text-based like Bash

## Are There Tools That Are Only One?

Yes! And here are examples:

Only Shells: cmd.exe, ash

Only Scripting Languages: Python, JavaScript, C

Table or bullets for clarity.

## Scripting Language vs Programming Language

Scripting = a subset of programming

Difference in compilation, performance, and use case

Why C is not a scripting language

Summary: All scripting is programming, but not all programming is scripting.

## Final Thoughts

Why this matters in real-world usage

Understanding PowerShellâ€™s dual role helps you write better tools

Encouragement to explore both modes
