# PowerShell Scripting Projects

This repository is a collection of PowerShell scripts I've created to explore Windows-based automation and solve everyday problems in a practical way. My main goal with this project is to learn PowerShell by applying it to real-world tasks. Along the way, I hope to make these tools accessible and useful for others who are new to scripting or interested in automating their own workflows.

## Understanding the Command Line

If you're new to scripting or command-line tools, don't worry - you're not alone. Many people feel intimidated at first, staring into the deep abyss of black windows with blinking cursors. But once you understand the three core building blocks - **the Operating System, the Shell, and the Terminal** - youâ€™ll see that itâ€™s not as mysterious or deep as it seems. With just a bit of guidance, you'll be ready to explore scripting step by step.

## Tools Overview

This section introduces the key tools used across the scripts and automation workflows in this repository. For detailed setup instructions, use the quick links below, or visit the `./Docs` folder.

If you are new to scripting, I recommend starting with the [PowerShell Setup Guide](./Docs/Setup/PowerShell_Setup.md) and following the tutorials sequentially until the environment is fully configured.

If you are already familiar with some tools or only need specific setups, feel free to jump directly to the ones you are interested in.

### Coding Environment

#### PowerShell 7.5

[PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/overview?view=powershell-7.5) is a powerful, cross-platform shell and scripting language developed by Microsoft. It's designed for task automation, system configuration, and integrates deeply with Windows and the .NET runtime. This project uses PowerShell 7.5 on Windows.

Compared to the traditional Command Prompt (cmd.exe), PowerShell offers:

- Object-based input/output instead of plain text
- More consistent syntax and naming conventions
- Support for logic, loops, functions, and structured error handling
- Built-in tools like `Get-Help` for discovering how commands work

PowerShell 7+ is open source and actively maintained on [GitHub](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/tree/master). Its growing ecosystem of modules and tools makes it ideal for both beginners and advanced users.

ðŸ‘‰ [PowerShell Setup Guide](./Docs/Setup/PowerShell_Setup.md)

#### Windows Terminal

[Windows Terminal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/) is a modern terminal app by Microsoft that supports multiple shells like PowerShell, Command Prompt, and WSL in a tabbed, customizable interface. It improves usability and adds modern features like transparency, Unicode, font ligatures, and theme control.

*Work in Progress*
ðŸ‘‰ [Windows Terminal Setup Guide](./Docs/Setup/WindowsTerminal_Setup.md)

### oh-my-posh

[oh-my-posh](https://ohmyposh.dev) is a sleek, highly configurable prompt renderer for PowerShell and other shells. It enhances the look and clarity of your terminal with icons, colors, and segments. It integrates with Nerd Fonts for full visual support.

ðŸ‘‰ [oh-my-posh Setup Guide](./Docs/Setup/oh-my-posh_Setup.md)

#### Visual Studio Code

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) (VSCode) is a lightweight yet powerful code editor with built-in support for PowerShell, Git, extensions, and debugging. Itâ€™s the primary editor used in this project for writing and managing scripts. The tutorials in this repo are based on the VSCode environment.

## Projects & Modules

### Set-TouchFile - Unix Touch Implementation in PowerShell with UX enhancements

Introduction to this tools

### Start-FastCopy â€“ Controlled Folder-by-Folder Copying via FastCopy

Project Start-FastCopy is a modular PowerShell wrapper designed to automate and control folder-level data transfers using the FastCopy free software. It provides an interface with control over speed, verification, simulation, and delay between folder transfers. This script is ideal for conducting copying multiple folders of size 50-100GB to a backup folder. Key features include:

- Automated Per-subfolder copying from source to target directory
- Set speed control with FastCopy presets at the terminal: full, autoslow, suspend, or custom (1â€“9)
- Post-copy file verification toggle
- Dry run simulation using FastCopyâ€™s /no_exec
- Optional thermal throttling with adjustable delay between folders
- Path to FastCopy.exe executable configuration via config.json
- Interactive confirmation with PowerShell ShouldProcess feature

*Work in Progress*
ðŸ‘‰ Check out the [Start-FastCopy README](./Project_Start-FastCopy/README.md)

### Simple-Functions - Collection of Small Scripts for Terminal Fun & Utility

The SimpleFunctions folder contains a growing collection of lightweight, self-contained PowerShell functions designed for fun, learning, and daily scripting enhancements. These scripts are ideal for exploring how to use loops, output formatting, animation tricks, and terminal interactivity in PowerShell.

Examples Include:

- `./Build-PowerShellBanner`: Renders a ASCII art of PowerShell in different fonts and a scanner-style animation
- Show-Triangle: Prints an expanding triangle row by row
- Show-Spiner: Displays a small ASCII spiner that just spins!

More fun and visual terminal scripts on the way!

While not tied to automation tasks, these functions are great for building intuition about PowerShell scripting and experimenting with creative terminal outputs.
