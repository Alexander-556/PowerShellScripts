# PowerShell Scripting Projects

This repository is a collection of powershell scripts and functions created to solve problems that are relevant to me. My main purpose for this repo is to learn powershell as a windows based automation tool to try to automate my daily routines.

## Tools Involved in Project

This section introduces the key tools used across scripts and setups in this repository. For setup instructions, visit the `./docs` folder.

### Coding Environment

#### PowerShell 7.5

[PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/) is a powerful cross-platform shell and scripting language developed by Microsoft, ideal for task automation and system configuration. It offers deep integration with the Windows operating system and the .NET runtime. This repository uses the latest PowerShell 7.5 on Windows.  

Compare to traditional  Command Prompt (cmd.exe), PowerShell includes advanced features and better syntax, with:

- Object-based output instead of plain text
- More consistent syntax and command naming
- Access to complex logic, loops, error handling, and functions
- Built-in support with `Get-Help` for working with files, processes, registry, networking, and more

PowerShell 7+ is open-source and actively maintained on the [PowerShell GitHub Repo](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/tree/master), with a strong and growing community that contributes modules, tools, and documentations. This ecosystem makes it a robust choice for both beginners and professionals.

â†’ [Install & Configure PowerShell](./docs/PowerShell_Setup.md)

#### Windows Terminal

[Windows Terminal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/) is Microsoftâ€™s modern terminal application that supports multiple profiles (e.g., PowerShell, Command Prompt, WSL) in a tabbed, customizable interface. It greatly improves usability over the default console, supports font ligatures, transparency, Unicode, and theme customization.

â†’ [Terminal Setup Guide](./docs/PowerShell_Setup.md)

#### oh-my-posh

[oh-my-posh](https://ohmyposh.dev) is a sleek and highly configurable prompt theming engine that enhances the visual appearance of your shell environment. It supports a wide range of themes and integrates with Nerd Fonts to display icons and glyphs. This tool adds both style and clarity to your command line workflows.

â†’ [Prompt Setup Guide](./docs/oh-my-posh_Setup.md)

#### Visual Studio Code

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) (VScode) is a popular code editor choice. It's lightweight and powerful with built-in support for PowerShell, Git, extensions, debugging and more. VScode is the primary editor used in this project for writing, testing, and managing PowerShell scripts efficiently, and the tutorials will be mainly based on VScode.

## Projects & Modules

### FastCopyTools â€“ Controlled Folder-by-Folder Copying via FastCopy

FastCopyTools is a modular PowerShell wrapper designed to automate and control folder-level data transfers using the FastCopy utility. It provides a scriptable interface with fine-tuned control over speed, verification, simulation, and delay between folder transfers.

ðŸ”§ Key Features
Per-subfolder copying from source to target directory

Speed control with presets: full, autoslow, suspend, or custom (1â€“9)

Post-copy file verification toggle

Dry run simulation using FastCopyâ€™s /no_exec

Thermal-friendly throttling with adjustable delay between folders

Path configuration via config.json for FastCopy binary location

Interactive confirmation with ShouldProcess

This tool is ideal for users who want more transparency, control, or automation than the FastCopy GUI provides.
