# PowerShell Scripting Projects

This repository is a collection of powershell scripts and functions created to solve problems that are relevant to me. My main purpose for this repo is to learn powershell as a windows based automation tool to try to automate my daily routines.

## Tools Involved in Project

This section introduces the key tools used across scripts and setups in this repository. For setup instructions, visit the `./Docs` folder or use the following links.

### Coding Environment

#### PowerShell 7.5

[PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/) is a powerful cross-platform shell and scripting language developed by Microsoft, ideal for task automation and system configuration. It offers deep integration with the Windows operating system and the .NET runtime. This repository uses the latest PowerShell 7.5 on Windows.  

Compare to traditional  Command Prompt (cmd.exe), PowerShell includes advanced features and better syntax, with:

- Object-based output instead of plain text
- More consistent syntax and command naming
- Access to complex logic, loops, error handling, and functions
- Built-in support with `Get-Help` for working with files, processes, registry, networking, and more

PowerShell 7+ is open-source and actively maintained on the [PowerShell GitHub Repo](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/tree/master), with a strong and growing community that contributes modules, tools, and documentations. This ecosystem makes it a robust choice for both beginners and professionals.

â†’ [Install & Configure PowerShell](./Docs/PowerShell_Setup.md)

#### Windows Terminal

[Windows Terminal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/) is Microsoftâ€™s modern terminal application that supports multiple profiles (e.g., PowerShell, Command Prompt, WSL) in a tabbed, customizable interface. It greatly improves usability over the default console, supports font ligatures, transparency, Unicode, and theme customization.

â†’ [Windows Terminal Setup Guide](./Docs/PowerShell_Setup.md)

#### oh-my-posh

[oh-my-posh](https://ohmyposh.dev) is a sleek and highly configurable prompt theming engine that enhances the visual appearance of your shell environment. It supports a wide range of themes and integrates with Nerd Fonts to display icons and glyphs. This tool adds both style and clarity to your command line workflows.

â†’ [oh-my-posh Setup Guide](./Docs/oh-my-posh_Setup.md)

#### Visual Studio Code

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) (VScode) is a popular code editor choice. It's lightweight and powerful with built-in support for PowerShell, Git, extensions, debugging and more. VScode is the primary editor used in this project for writing, testing, and managing PowerShell scripts efficiently, and the tutorials will be mainly based on VScode.

## Projects & Modules

### Start-FastCopy â€“ Controlled Folder-by-Folder Copying via FastCopy

Project Start-FastCopy is a modular PowerShell wrapper designed to automate and control folder-level data transfers using the FastCopy free software. It provides an interface with control over speed, verification, simulation, and delay between folder transfers. This script is ideal for conducting copying multiple folders of size 50-100GB to a backup folder. Key features include:

- Automated Per-subfolder copying from source to target directory
- Set speed control with FastCopy presets at the terminal: full, autoslow, suspend, or custom (1â€“9)
- Post-copy file verification toggle
- Dry run simulation using FastCopyâ€™s /no_exec
- Optional thermal throttling with adjustable delay between folders
- Path to FastCopy.exe executable configuration via config.json
- Interactive confirmation with PowerShell ShouldProcess feature

â†’ Check out the [Start-FastCopy README](./Project_Start-FastCopy/README.md)

### Simple-Functions - Small Scripts for Terminal Fun & Utility

The SimpleFunctions folder contains a growing collection of lightweight, self-contained PowerShell functions designed for fun, learning, and daily scripting enhancements. These scripts are ideal for exploring how to use loops, output formatting, animation tricks, and terminal interactivity in PowerShell.

Examples Include:

- `./Build-PowerShellBanner`: Renders a ASCII art of PowerShell in different fonts and a scanner-style animation
- Show-Triangle: Prints an expanding triangle row by row
- Show-Spiner: Displays a small ASCII spiner that just spins!

More fun and visual terminal scripts on the way!

While not tied to automation tasks, these functions are great for building intuition about PowerShell scripting and experimenting with creative terminal outputs.
