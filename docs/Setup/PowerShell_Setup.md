## Installation of PowerShell 7.5

In this repository, I work on PowerShell 7.5, available through [this link from microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-windows?view=powershell-7.5). You can install through msi installer or `winget`, the Windows Package Manager. Microsoft recommends installing PowerShell 7.5 using `winget`, here's how:

### Verify Winget command

Since `winget` is a command-line tool, we need to launch [PowerShell 5.1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_windows_powershell_5.1?view=powershell-5.1) first. This shell is built into windows, and we can launch it by first pressing `Win + R`, then type `powershell` and hit `Enter`. A terminal window should pop up. We will type the commands in the terminal window.

Check if your computer has `winget` by typing

```powershell
winget --Version
```

If the terminal says:

```powershell
winget: The term 'winget' is not recognized as a name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or executable program.
Check the spelling of the name, or if a path was included, verify that the path is correct and try again.
```

then this means you need to install `winget`. Please go to this [Winget Installation Guide](./Winget_Setup.md) for more details.

If your terminal displays a version number like

```powershell
> winget --version
v1.10.390
```

then you are all set with `winget` and ready to install PowerShell 7.5.

### Installation Command

First, search for the latest version of PowerShell with

```powershell
winget search Microsoft.PowerShell
```

You would see the following output as of May 29th, 2025:

```powershell
Name               Id                           Version Source
---------------------------------------------------------------
PowerShell         Microsoft.PowerShell         7.5.1.0 winget
PowerShell Preview Microsoft.PowerShell.Preview 7.6.0.4 winget
```

Then install PowerShell 7.5.1, the stable version, with

```powershell
winget install --id Microsoft.PowerShell --source winget
```

By this step, PowerShell 7.5 should be installed on your computer and ready to use.

### How to Configure PowerShell

To config PowerShell, you need to edit the profile file. Upon startup of every session, PowerShell will first execute the scripts or commands within `$PROFILE`.

You can open the profile file by typing:

```powershell
notepad $PROFILE
```

The above command opens the profile file with notepad. You can use other editors if you put the path to their executables in the environment variable `PATH`, for example:

```powershell
code $PROFILE      # Uses VScode
notepad++ $PROFILE # Uses notepad++
```

To see an example of how to add an executable path to `PATH`, you can later check out the "Environment Variable" section of tutorial [oh-my-posh Setup](./oh-my-posh_Setup.md#environment-variable).

When you execute the `notepad $PROFILE` command, notepad might prompt you that the file doesn't exist and whether to create a new one. Make sure to choose yes, if you want to customize your PowerShell. The following PowerShell command does the same thing, it creates a new `$PROFILE` file at the correct location. If the previous method don't work, you can try the command:

```powershell
New-Item -Path $PROFILE -Type File -Force
```

and then try

```powershell
notepad $PROFILE
```

This should correctly open the profile file. The configuration of PowerShell 7.5 will continue after we setup the terminal we want to use at [Windows Terminal Setup Guide](./WindowsTerminal_Setup.md). Or if you want to skip the terminal setup, you can go to [oh-my-posh Setup Guide](./oh-my-posh_Setup.md). However, I still recommend that you should read the following "Things to Keep in Mind" section before proceeding.

## Things to Keep in Mind

### Verify Your PowerShell Version

#### PowerShell 5.1 and 7.5 Compatibility

According to [this documentation from Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/whats-new/migrating-from-windows-powershell-51-to-powershell-7?view=powershell-7.5#using-powershell-7-side-by-side-with-windows-powershell-51), Installing PowerShell 7.5 doesn't mean it replaces PowerShell 5.1., PowerShell 5, 6, and 7 each installs to

- Windows PowerShell 5.1: `$Env:windir\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0`
- PowerShell 6.x: `$Env:ProgramFiles\PowerShell\6`
- PowerShell 7: `$Env:ProgramFiles\PowerShell\7`

This means that you can use PowerShell 5.1 and 7 at the same time, which is great for compatibility. I recommend you use PowerShell 7, but you can also consult the following official articles from microsoft:

- [Differences between Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell 7.x](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/whats-new/differences-from-windows-powershell?view=powershell-7.5)
- [Migrating from Windows PowerShell 5.1 to PowerShell 7](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/whats-new/migrating-from-windows-powershell-51-to-powershell-7?view=powershell-7.5)

and make your own decisions for which version to use based on your needs.

#### Check PowerShell Version

Since installing new version of powershell doesn't replace the old one, you should always be aware of the version of the PowerShell you are working with. To check your PowerShell version, use

```powershell
$Host.Version
```

Windows default PowerShell 5 would may output something like:

```powershell
Major  Minor  Build  Revision
-----  -----  -----  --------
5      1      22621  4391
```

If you have the PowerShell 7.5 installed, you would see something like:

```powershell
Major  Minor  Build  Revision
-----  -----  -----  --------
7      5      1      -1
```

Note that if you see "-1" in your version data, don't panic, and there is nothing wrong. According to [Microsoft Documentation for .NET System.Version Class](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fundamentals/runtime-libraries/system-version), "-1" just means this value has not been explicitly set.

#### Launch Your Desired PowerShell Version

If you just successfully installed PowerShell 7.5, but you didn't see the correct version number. It's possible that you are using the PowerShell 5.1 terminal. If you haven't done any personalization on your terminal, it can be very confusing sometimes. Here is a way to make sure you are using the correct version of powershell.

Press `Win + R` to invoke the Windows Run menu.

- Type "powershell" if you want to run PowerShell 5.1
- Type "pwsh" if you want to run PowerShell 7.5

This works because according to [this documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/whats-new/differences-from-windows-powershell?view=powershell-7.5#renamed-powershellexe-to-pwshexe), compared to version 5.1, Microsoft renamed PowerShell 7.5 executable from `powershell.exe` to `pwsh.exe` for clear distinction.
