# Windows Terminal

## Installation of Windows Terminal

I mainly work on Windows, so Windows Terminal is my first choice for a terminal, available through the [Microsoft Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9n0dx20hk701?hl=en-US&gl=US). Compare to default Command Prompt and Windows PowerShell console, this one is a lot more modern and is a lot more customizable. Key features include tab support, different profile in one window, etc. For more details, consult the [Windows Terminal Official Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/).
